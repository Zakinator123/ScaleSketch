We're excited to introduce **ScaleSketch**, a free measurement tool designed for anyone who needs to take accurate measurements from images, floor plans, or blueprints.

## Why We Built ScaleSketch

Whether you're a homeowner planning a renovation, a contractor estimating materials, or an architect reviewing plans, you've probably faced the challenge of measuring spaces from images or PDFs. Existing tools are either:

- Too expensive for occasional use
- Require software installation
- Have a steep learning curve
- Don't work on all platforms

ScaleSketch solves these problems by running entirely in your browser—no installation, no account, no cost.

## Key Features

### 1. Simple Scale Calibration

Set a known distance once, and all your measurements are automatically calibrated. Draw a line on a 10-foot wall, tell ScaleSketch it's 10 feet, and you're ready to measure everything else.

### 2. Multiple Drawing Tools

- **Lines**: For simple distance measurements
- **Rectangles**: Perfect for rooms and rectangular spaces
- **Polygons**: Handle irregular shapes with ease

### 3. Real-Time Calculations

See area, perimeter, and dimensions instantly as you draw. No need to calculate square footage manually—ScaleSketch does it for you.

### 4. Privacy First

Your images never leave your browser. Everything runs locally, so your floor plans and measurements stay private.

### 5. Professional Features

- Undo/redo support
- Shape labeling and organization
- Rotation and vertex editing
- Multiple unit support (feet/meters)
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
