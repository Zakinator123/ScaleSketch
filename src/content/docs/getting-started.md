## Welcome to ScaleSketch

ScaleSketch is a browser-based measurement tool that lets you draw precisely measured shapes on images. Perfect for floor plans, blueprints, and architectural drawings.

### 2. Set the Scale

Before you can get accurate measurements, you need to calibrate the scale:

1. Click the **"Set Scale"** tool in the left sidebar
2. Draw a line along a known distance on your image (like a wall marked as 10 feet)
3. Enter the real-world distance in the dialog
4. Choose your unit (feet or meters)

The scale is now set! All measurements will be calculated based on this calibration.

### 3. Draw Shapes
